# Feed-The-Seals
Simple game where you start with one fish and one sea lion. You feed the fish to the sea lion, it then brings a friend and you have 2 fish, this goes on and on adding more sea lions. Enjoy!

How to play:
- Double-click feed_the_seals.exe
- Draggable windows will pop up:
  → "Fish" windows (spinning fish video)
  → "Hungry Seal" windows (sped-up sea lion video)
- Drag any Fish window (by the title bar) onto a Hungry Seal window
- When they overlap → both disappear (seal is fed!)
- Feed ALL seals in the current level → more seals and fish appear
- It keeps going forever and gets increasingly chaotic

Important:
- REQUIRES INTERNET CONNECTION
  The videos stream directly from online links.
  Nothing is downloaded or saved to your computer.

- No installation needed
- Works on Windows (tested on Windows 10/11)
- Simple Project to learn coding more.
- Yes I know that they are sea lions, they are similar enough lol
